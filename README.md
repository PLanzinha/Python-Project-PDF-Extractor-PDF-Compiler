# Advanced PDF Extractor

This Python project aims to extract text, images, links, and tables from PDF files using several libraries.

It processes all PDF files in a directory and compiles the extracted data into text files, an images folder, and a new PDF file that contains all the extracted tables.

### Features

    Text Extraction: Extracts text from PDF pages and compiles it into a single .txt file.
    Image Extraction: Saves images from each PDF page into a specified folder.
    Link Extraction: Extracts all URLs from PDFs and compiles them into a .txt file.
    Table Extraction: Extracts tables from PDFs and merges them into a single PDF.
